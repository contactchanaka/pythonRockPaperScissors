## Rock Paper Scissors

Start the game by asking the player:

*"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."*

Logic: 
* Store the user's input.
* Generate a random choice for the computer.
* Compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
* Give feedback to the player.
